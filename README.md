# Project 1: Pendulum
# Yassi Khorsandian & Allison Choi

The goal of this project was to create a simulation of a pendulum and to use the data obtained from this simulation to create graphs of angles, velocities, and accelerations. Furthermore, this project aimed to obtain real-world data using a microbit and to compare these values with the ones obtained from the simulation.

## Instructions

The file named "plots.py" contains the code for creating the graphs for the simulation, and "DataAnalysis.py" contains the code for the analysis of the data obtained from the microbit. The length of the pendulum is a value that must be measured and entered as the value of the variable "l" in both codes. 
The files named "firstTrial.txt," "secondTrial.txt," "thirdTrial.txt," "fourthTrial.txt," and "fifthTrial.txt" contain the measured values of accelerations and time obtained from the microbit. 
The file named "DataCollection.py" contains the code that was flashed onto the microbit and used to collect the time and acceleration values.
